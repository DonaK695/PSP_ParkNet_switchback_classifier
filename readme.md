# 🌟 ParkerNet: Deep Learning for Switchback Classification 🚀

## 🔥 Project Highlights  
Switchbacks—**abrupt disturbances or reversals in the radial magnetic field of the solar wind**—have been extensively studied since NASA’s **Parker Solar Probe (PSP)** mission. These disturbances could hold the key to understanding how the **solar wind is heated and accelerated**. 🌞💨  

In this project, we introduce **ParkerNet**—a **Deep Learning model** designed to classify switchbacks in **PSP data** for the first time! 🧠📡  

✅ **Trained on PSP FIELDS and SPC instrument measurements**.  
✅ **Quickly classifies switchbacks** in PSP data.  
✅ **Version 1.0**, with future improvements planned, including **explainable AI** and upgraded capabilities. 🚀
